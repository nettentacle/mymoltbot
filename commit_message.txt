Enhancement: Improve solar system visuals

1. Enhanced Sun:
   - Increased glow effect (3 layers)
   - Higher emissive intensity (2.0)
   - Emissive map for texture glow
   - Stronger point lights
   - Better visible texture

2. Improved Halley's Comet:
   - Longer multi-layer tail (2 cones)
   - Larger coma (1.0 radius)
   - Brighter core (emissive 1.5)
   - More visible tail effect

3. Adjusted brightness:
   - Planets: roughness 0.6, metalness 0.3
   - Moons: roughness 0.7, metalness 0.2
   - Rings: transparency 0.8
   - Better light reflection

All celestial bodies now properly visible and bright!
